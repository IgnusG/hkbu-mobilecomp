This repository holds assignment solutions for the course Mobile Computing at HKBU.  
These solutions **are my own** and **NOT guaranteed** to be correct.

#### Building the Source
This project uses latex for compiling the source into a pdf. These latex packages are used:
- `fontenc` - encoding adjustment to render symbols such as | (pipe)
- `xcolor` - specify custom colors
- `amsmath` - math environment
- `witharrows` - math environment with step-by-step arrows
- `ulem` - strike-through text
- `graphicx` - include images
- `titlesec` - configuration for custom sections/subsections
- `enumitem` - more configurable enumerate environment
- `pifont` - additional symbols (checkmark/cross)

These packages require the following arch/aur packages for Arch Linux: `texlive-latexextra`, `texlive-science`.  
The project can be built using `latexmk`.
